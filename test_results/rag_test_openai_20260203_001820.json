      "response": "Demandable Capacity refers to the difference between the high and low power limits within a demand facility. It represents the available capacity that can be called upon or managed to meet energy demands, especially during peak usage times or to respond to system constraints. This concept is crucial for ensuring that the energy system can effectively balance supply and demand, particularly in the context of managing transmission constraints through demand response mechanisms.",
