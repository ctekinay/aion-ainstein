# Energy-Efficient Designed Operations

## Statement
AI solutions must be designed for energy-efficient **stationary operations**, ensuring that once deployed, they minimize energy consumption without compromising acceptable performance and outcome quality.

## Rationale
While full energy neutrality is currently impractical, focusing on operational efficiency delivers measurable sustainability benefits. It reduces long-term energy costs, aligns with environmental goals, and supports responsible innovation.

## Implications
- Design for **energy efficiency in steady-state operations**, even if development phases are more energy-intensive.
- Optimize inference and production workloads for **minimal energy footprint**.
- Prefer architectures and algorithms that balance **performance and energy use**.
- Include **energy efficiency metrics** in operational monitoring and vendor selection.
- Continuous tuning for energy efficiency during lifecycle management.
