# Digital Authoritative Language Governance

## Statement
Within a digitized landscape, and especially with AI, languate translation (eg. from Dutch to English) takes place easilly. However business decisions increasingly depends on the 
quality and the means of translation. Therefore decisions and artefacts must use authoritative, versioned language standards to ensure clarity, compliance, risk reduction, and interoperability across all systems and processes.

## Rationale
Consistent and authoritative language prevents misinterpretation, supports regulatory compliance, reduces operational and legal risk, and enables reliable automation and AI governance.

## Implications
- Introduce termbase/glossary and translation memory with governance.
- Configure AI governance (RAG policies, citation enforcement, equivalence checks).
- Add audit controls: every decision artefact must pass provenance validation.
- Train teams or agents on difference between co‑authoritative vs informative translations and how to cite them.
- Consider different interpretations of languages in all manual and automated decision-making.
- Consider adopting language tags and versioning standards across repositories.
